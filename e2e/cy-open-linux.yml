# run web application and open Cypress Test Runner in a Docker container
# but send the X11 output to the server running on the host machine
# so you can see and interact with the tests. Most services are configured
# in the file docker-compose.yml, this file only overrides variables
# necessary for "cypress open" to work with X11 on linux.
#
# We need to use both file names to run:
#
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cy-open-linux.yml up --exit-code-from cypress
#
services:
  cypress:
    # pass custom command to start Cypress otherwise it will use the entrypoint
    #     specified in the Cypress Docker image.
    # also pass "--project <folder>" so that when Cypress opens
    #     it can find file "cypress.json" and show integration specs
    # https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-open
    entrypoint: cypress open --project /e2e
    environment:
      # get the IP address of the host machine and allow X11 to accept
      # incoming connections from that IP address
      #
      #   /usr/X11/bin/xhost +local:
      #
      # This should look as follows:
      #
      #   $ xhost +local:
      #   non-network local connections being added to access control list
      #   $
      #
      - DISPLAY
    volumes:
      # for Cypress to communicate with the X11 server pass this socket file
      #     in addition to any other mapped volumes
      - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix
